# 🔐 Vigenère Cipher Decryption Tool

This is a simple Python program that decrypts a message using the Vigenère cipher algorithm — one of the most famous encryption methods in classical cryptography.

##  What is the Vigenère Cipher?

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It's like Caesar Cipher's smarter, cooler cousin 😎

##  How It Works

The script uses a key (a word like `python`) to decrypt a message encrypted with the same key.

### Example

```python
text = 'mrttaqrhknsw ih puggrur'
key = 'python'
Output: 
Decrypted text: congratulations

### How to Use

1. Clone the repo or copy the code.

2. Run the Python script.

3. Change the text and key variables to test with your own encrypted messages.
